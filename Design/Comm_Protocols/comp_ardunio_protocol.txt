Ideas:

comp (master) - Arduino (slave)

Do some sort of encapsulation and decapsulation
	- Allows us to process both request kinematics and send haptics in same msg
	- sent: {Header for specific request { Header for kinematics request } }
		- This way the arduino can service both requests sequentially

What is max size message?
How long should timeout be for comp request before sending another?

Case 0: Initialization of glove communication
	- Need 2 way handshake to confirm connection working
		- Comp sends data msg to arduino and waits for response
	- Discovery of available controls
		- Could be useful for modularity (discover has access to tactile and/or force haptics)

Case 1: Computer wants orientation of sensors for kinematics
	- Comp Sent
		- Sets flag for kinematics request
		- Indicates addresses of sensors needed
 	- Arduino Sent
		- Sets flag for kinematics response
		- Payload contains data in specified ordering
	- Comp Sent
		- Confirmation? Maybe not enough time between requests
		- Could keep track of number of requests without recieving Ard to monitor health of connection

Case 2: Computer wants to send instructions to haptic control
	- Comp Sent
		- Sets flag for haptic control
		- Payload indicates sensor addresses with specified values for each
			- Potentially have value translation to abstract the process for the computer game
	- Arduino Sent
		- Sets flag for haptic response
		- Whether successful or not (Maybe no completely necessary)
			- Could judge from kinematic response msgs

Overall:
	- Comp sends {Kinematic Request { haptic controls } }
	- Arduino responds with { { Kinematic Data } Success of Previous Haptic control }
		- Comp waits for response
		- If too long without response, will send another control msg
			- Improves latency of system

Message Format:
- Comp sent:
	- Kinematic Request Header - Fixed size
		- Size of payload (Payload is haptic controls + controls header) 
		- If payload present (Haptic controls sent)
		- Addresses of requested sensor data
		- Type of sensor requested (Could be stated in addresses)
	- Haptic Controls Header
		- Size of payload
		-
